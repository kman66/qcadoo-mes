qcadoo MES is a server web application. Because of this it's not trivial
to install but once you do it then everyone in your local network will have
access to the system through a browser.

The installation process requires some basic technical skills. Please read the

qcadoo MES in to your LAN network

If you would just like to start working with qcadoo MES and not worry about
the systems configuration, updates and backups then we recommend to buy it as
a hosted internet application from Qcadoo in the Software as a Service model
(called SaaS in short). Please see the How to buy page:
